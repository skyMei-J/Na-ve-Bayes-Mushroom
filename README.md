# Na-ve-Bayes-Mushroom


Data

## 1. Mushroom dataset

the first column is the label (edible=e, poisonous=p)
Data Set Information:
This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ‘‘leaflets three, let it be’’ for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## 2. Iris dataset

Data can be downloaded here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

Data Set Information:
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher’s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. This is an exceedingly simple domain.
